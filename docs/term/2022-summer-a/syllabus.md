# Instructional Mode

The instructional mode for this course is *Online Asynchronous*. The course will
be conducted online in its entirety, and there will be no specific time of day
during which you are required to participate in a course activity. You will be
responsible for setting your own schedule for completing course readings,
watching pre-recorded lecture videos, submitting assignments and taking exams no
later than the published deadlines, and completing all other activities required
by this course.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be successful
in this course. At a minimum, you must have a computer and a broadband Internet
connection capable of interacting with Canvas and Vocareum via a web browser, as
well as streaming video and audio of pre-recorded lectures.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be set
in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct).  You are
responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of what your local
time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the instructions linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414)
to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid any
confusion.

# Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined by the points you earn on items
in the following categories.

- **Exams** (40%): There will be three exams in the course, including the final
  exam. Dates for the first two exams will be set and announced at least one
  week in advance. All three exams will be administered online using the
  Honorlock proctoring system. Missed exams are assigned a score of zero points.

- **Lab Tests** (25%): There will be three programming-based tests in the
  course. Dates for each will be set and announced at least one week in advance.
  All three tests will be administered online using the Honorlock proctoring
  system. Lab Test grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed
  on Vocareum. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.
  Missed lab tests are assigned a score of zero points.

- **Assignments** (30%): There will be seven assignments designed to both
  reinforce and expand on the topics covered in lecture. Each assignment will
  specify a well-defined problem with multiple possible solutions. You will be
  required to apply what you have learned, discover new information, and
  exercise creative problem solving to construct a solution that meets the
  problem specification. All assignments require you to express solutions in
  Java.  Most assignments will be completed individually while some may be
  completed in teams. Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, all assignments
  are to be completed individually and must reflect your own individual work.
  Assignment grades will be based on the percentage of test cases passed on
  Vocareum. Passing zero test cases will result in a grade of zero points.
  Assignments not completed by the specified deadline are assigned a score of
  zero points.

- **Hands-On Activities** (5%): There will be a set of hands-on activities
  designed to both reinforce and expand on the topics covered in lecture.
  Hands-on activities not completed by the specified deadline are assigned a
  score of zero points.

Your total score (*Total*) for the course will be calculated as follows, where
*E* is the percentage of possible points earned on exams, *A* is the percentage
of possible points earned on assignments, *T* is the percentage of possible
points earned on lab tests, and *H* is the percentage of possible points earned
on hands-on activities. Each percentage is calculated as (*points earned* /
*points possible*) * 100.


*Total* = (0.4 * *E*) + (0.25 * *T*) + (0.3 * *A*) + (0.05 * *H*)

Your letter grade for the course will be assigned based on your *Total*
numeric score using the following scale.

*Total*   | Letter Grade
--------  | ------------
[90, 100] | A
[80, 90)  | B
[70, 80)  | C
[60, 70)  | D
[0, 60)   | F

**Extra Credit:** Opportunities for extra credit are sometimes given to the
entire class, but are never given on an individual basis.

# Course Policies


## Attendance

Since this course is being conducted in Online Asynchronous mode, "engagement"
better captures what is expected rather than "attendance." You are expected to
fully engage in this course and take responsibility for your learning
experience. Lack of engagement almost always leads to poor course performance.

If illness or an emergency situation prevents you from being able to
participate in the course, please contact me in advance of affected deadlines
if possible. See other syllabus policies regarding extended absences, late
submissions, and make-ups.


## Excused Absences

To have a covid-related absence excused you must provide the course instructor
with an official email from the AU COVID-19 Resource Center (CRC). This email
can only be obtained by filing a [student self-report
form](http://auburn.edu/covid-resource-center/reporting/) with the CRC.

To have a non-covid absence excused you must first obtain an Excused Absence
Memo from Engineering Student Services (ESS) for any absence that falls into
categories 1 through 6 in the AU Policy on Class Attendance. You should contact
the course instructor directly for other absences.

> Engineering Student Services provides excused absence memos to students who
> present verifiable documentation related to university excused absences.  The
> steps for obtaining an excused absence memo are as follows:
>
> 1. The student submits the request form using this link:
     >    [https://aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence)
     >    - Students submit documentation of the reason for the absence.
>    - Students must read and acknowledge the excused absence policy.
>
> 1. The ESS office staff processes the requests and verifies authenticity of
     >    documentation provided by student, as well as the dates of the absence(s).
>
> 1. Assistant Dean determines if the documentation meets the standard for a
     >    university excused absence or if the documentation warrants consideration
     >    by the professor.
>
> 1. An official memo is sent directly to professors via email regarding the
     >    student’s absence

## Exam and Test Makeup

A missed exam or test can only be made up for excused absences (see policy).
Students must contact the instructor **within 48 hours** from the time that the
exam or test was given or the exam or test score will remain zero. The makeup
schedule is determined by the instructor and will need to be done within five
business days from the time that the exam or test was given.


## Late Assignment Submission

All assignments are due no later than the date and time specified in Canvas, and
no late submissions are accepted. If you believe that your situation warrants an
exception to this policy (e.g., medical emergency) you must treat this as an
*absence* and have the absence excused (see policy).

## Connectivity Issues

If connectivity issues (e.g., Internet connection problems, electrical power
failures) prevent you from completing an element of the course on time, you must
notify the instructor immediately when the incident occurs (email to
`dh@auburn.edu` and/or voicemail to 334-844-6305) and then provide appropriate
documentation (e.g., service provider notices) within one hour of the incident.
No extensions or makeup opportunities will be available otherwise.


## Time Commitment

Auburn University has the following
[expectation](http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/student_policies/) of the
time commitment and  work that a course will require per credit hour. "*Auburn
University expects that for each credit hour awarded, an appropriately
prepared student will complete an average of 3-3.5 hours of academic work per
week over the length of a 15 week semester.*" This time estimate is
independent of instructional mode, so although this course is being offered
Online Asynchronous, you should plan on spending the same amount of
preparation, work, and “in class” time on this course as you would if you were
taking the course face-to-face. Also, since this course is being offered in a
compressed 7.5 format, the expected amount of time per week is effectively
doubled.

This course carries three credit hours, so at a minimum, an "appropriately
prepared" student (read: you did great in COMP 1220) would be expected to
spend 3 * 3 * 2 = 18 hours each week working on this course. Regardless of the
specifics, you should be prepared to allocate an appropriate amount of time
for this course.


## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is critical to the entire educational process and is a
serious matter in this course. You are expected to apply the
[Auburn University Oath of Honor](https://wp.auburn.edu/sga/initatives/academic-affairs/oath-of-honor/)
to each graded item in this course:

> In accordance with those virtues of Honesty and Truthfulness set forth in the
> Auburn Creed, I, as a student and fellow member of the Auburn family, do
> hereby pledge that all work is my own, achieved through personal merit and
> without any unauthorized aid. In the promotion of integrity, and for the
> betterment of Auburn, I give honor to this, my oath and obligation.

Issues surrounding violations of academic honesty will be handled per the
[Student Academic Honesty Code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/policies/academichonestycode.pdf).
You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with this policy and the other
resources available from the
[Office of Academic Effectiveness](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/academic-effectiveness/academic-honesty.php).

What constitutes cheating on exams and tests is fairly obvious, and everyone
understands that anything other than individual work on these is wrong. Where
many students are unsure of what is allowable and what is not allowable is in
the completion of programming assignments. I encourage students to form study
groups, help each other learn the course material, and help each other solve
problems. Collaborative problem solving is a great way to learn. However,
collaborative problem solving must be restricted to the level of concepts,
strategies, and algorithms; it should never involve source code. If you're in
doubt about a certain practice, it's best to ask rather than assume it's okay.
In certain instances, course work is to be completed in groups rather than
individually, but these instances will be clearly identified by the instructor
and the collaboration is allowed only within the bounds set by the instructor.


## Communication with Instructor and Teaching Assistants

Your Auburn University email address (`@auburn.edu`) is the university-approved
form of communication between instructors and students. Emails that you send to
the instructor or to a teaching assistant must come from your `@auburn.edu`
email address. Sending emails from addresses other than `@auburn.edu` could
result in you not receiving a response to your message. Do not send messages via
Canvas; instead, send an email.

All course announcements will be posted to Canvas and/or sent to your
`@auburn.edu` address. All email communications from the instructor to you
will be sent to your `@auburn.edu` address. Follow the steps in the video
linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Notification-Preferences-All-Users/ta-p/383690)
to set your notifications preferences and specify that all course alerts are
routed to your `@auburn.edu` email address. You are expected to check both
Canvas and your `@auburn.edu` account daily.


## Getting Help in the Course

If you find yourself struggling academically in this course, please reach out
to your instructor and/or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Do not
wait until the end of the term to seek help for problems that were present
much earlier. The instructor and teaching assistants want to help you, but can
not do so unless you ask in a timely manner.


## Accessibility

Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their
approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with me
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are
immediately needed. If you need accommodations but have not established them,
make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center,
334-844-2096.


## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be
viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, religion,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, veteran status, ethnicity,
race, and culture. All students in this course are expected to respect their
fellow classmates and actively participate in fostering an inclusive learning
environment. If you experience anything in this class that makes you feel
uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention and we will formulate a
response. If you would prefer to remain anonymous you may complete a
[Bias Incident Report](http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/bert/submit-a-report-of-bias/)
which will maintain your confidentiality.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.


## Classroom Behavior

The Auburn University [Policy on Classroom
Behavior](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/PolicyonClassroomBehavior.pdf)
is strictly followed in this course. Note that this policy extends to all
virtual elements of this course including Zoom, Vocareum, Discord, and all
electronic communication.


## Grade Appeals

Scores for all graded items will be posted to Canvas. You will have five
business days from the date that a score is posted to Canvas to send an email
to the instructor requesting grade adjustments on your work. If no appeal is
sent to the instructor after five business days, the score is final. Once the
five-day appeal period has passed, students forfeit their right to have the
graded material reassessed at a later date.

To appeal a grade that you have received, send an email to the instructor
specifying the graded item in question and justifying in a clear, concise
manner why you think your response should be awarded more points. Once
received, the instructor may or may not communicate with you regarding your
appeal. Ultimately, the instructor will render a decision.


## Extended Student Absence

If illness causes you to be unable to participate in the course, please
contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options.


## Extended Instructor Absence

If illness causes me to be unable to continue teaching the course, a back-up
instructor has been selected who will assume all teaching responsibilities to
ensure that the course will proceed uninterrupted.


## Auburn University Transition to Remote Operations

Since this course is being delivered in Online Asynchronous mode, neither
course requirements nor course delivery will change in the event that the
University is forced to move to remote operations and fully online
instruction.


## Data Collection and Use Disclosure

Any and all results of graded items in the course are data sources for
research and assessment, and may be used in publications related to research
and accreditation. All such use will be anonymous.
