# Security in Software Testing - DAST

In this module we focus on Dynamic Application Security Testing or DAST.  Unlike SAST testing, DAST testing is performed against a running application and attempts to discover vulnerabilities based on the application architecture and integration characteristics.  Since so much of public applications are based on the HTTP protocol we will focus the next two modules on web application security.  

As the internet has evolved so has the application architectures and associated attack vectors on them.  The threats and vulnerabilities change over time and so do the techniques used to prevent them.  Similar to SAST testing, DAST testing for web applications searches for known vulnerabilities.  We will review common web vulnerabilities, prevention techniques, DAST tools, and automated testing in our build pipelines.
