# Gitlab Merge Requests

Merge requests (MRs) are the way you check source code changes into a branch. When you open a merge request, you can visualize and collaborate on the code changes before merge.  Source code change control is an important practice to ensure the risk vulnerabilities being introduced is minimized.

# Challenges with Secure Software Development Today

Much of the software that comprises software applications is not what is typically developed by a software organization.  The proliferation of open source and 3rd party components has made software development faster, cheaper, better quality, and more secure.  However it also introduces challenges with ensuring and maintaining secure software.

# Git Version Control Tool

Git will be used throughout the course to manage our source code, build automation, CI/CD pipeline.  Git has become increasingly popular over the last 10 years and is a tool that every software developer will encounter.  Having a firm understanding of core git commands is key to success in this course.

## Maven Automated Build Tool

Maven is a build automatoin tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process and eliminates much of the decision making for a development team around how to build packages. It makes the day-to-day work of Java developers easier by eliminating manual tasks and providing a reliable and repeatable build process.
