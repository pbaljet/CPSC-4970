# Gitlab Merge Requests

Merge requests (MRs) are the way you check source code changes into a branch. When you open a merge request, you can visualize and collaborate on the code changes before merge.  Source code change control is an important practice to ensure the risk vulnerabilities being introduced is minimized.
