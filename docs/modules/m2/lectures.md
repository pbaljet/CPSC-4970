# Gitlab Merge Requests

Merge requests (MRs) are the way you check source code changes into a branch. When you open a merge request, you can visualize and collaborate on the code changes before merge.  Source code change control is an important practice to ensure the risk vulnerabilities being introduced is minimized.

# Security Analysis & Thread Modeling

Before building a automated and secure build pipeline we need to understand how to identify the threats and vulnerabilities of our software application, assess the risk level of each vulnerability, and decide on mitigation to take.

# Security Code Testing Methods

In this course we will be incorporating several security testing tools into our build pipeline.  Each of them have their specific purpose and are complimentary with some overlap.  There are also advantages and disadvantage that should be understood to build a holistic security testing approach.
