# Succeeding in This Module 2

Now that we have the core version control and automated build tools installed and an understanding of how they work we can begin building our secure development pipeline.  The foundation of all development processes in people and incorporating secure software development practices starts with a focus on the role people and the associated manual processes used.

# Module Objectives
