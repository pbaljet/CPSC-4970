# Importance of Cyber Security

The following video lectures provide a broad overview of the importance of security in software development as part of an organizations comprehensive security program. Also covered are a number of industry standards that will be referenced throughout the course as we examine how security practices can be used to prevent, detect, and remediate different types of security threats.

# Cyber Security in Software Development Lifecycle

This set of lecture videos introduces **correctness** as a goal for our solutions
and **testing** as a method of approaching it. Correctness verification is one of
the most important activities that occur in a software development project, and
the testing skills introduced in this set of videos are vital to becoming a
software developer.

# Cyber Security Standards

A common language and framework to communicate security related information is important to ensure rapid understanding and comprehensive coverage.  This lecture video describes the NIST standards and the National Vulnerability Database.

# Setting up Development Environment

We would like to write code that is **general** and **abstract** rather
than tied to a concrete and specific context. The advantages of this include
greater reuse, increased robustness, and often times better efficiency. This set
of videos takes you through important concepts in writing general code in Java.

## Java Installation and Verification

This video discusses coding style, code structure, and the idea of clean, simple
code and the influence these ideas have on correctness.


## Git Version Control

Testing is only as useful as the test cases that you design. In this video you
will learn about different perspectives on testing, as well as the basics of
purposeful test case design.


## Maven Build Automation

We would like to write code that is **general** and **abstract** rather
than tied to a concrete and specific context. The advantages of this include
greater reuse, increased robustness, and often times better efficiency. This set
of videos takes you through important concepts in writing general code in Java.
