# Cyber Security Today

The following video lectures provide a broad overview of the importance of security in software development as part of
an organizations comprehensive security program. Also covered are a number of industry standards that will be referenced
throughout the course as we examine how security practices can be used to prevent, detect, and remediate different types
of security threats.

# Cyber Security Industry Standards

A common language and framework to communicate security related information is important to ensure rapid understanding
and comprehensive coverage. This lecture video describes the NIST standards and the National Vulnerability Database.

# Challenges with Secure Software Development Today

Much of the software that comprises software applications is not what is typically developed by a software organization.
The proliferation of open source and 3rd party components has made software development faster, cheaper, better quality,
and more secure. However it also introduces challenges with ensuring and maintaining secure software.

# Git Version Control Tool

Git will be used throughout the course to manage our source code, build automation, CI/CD pipeline.  Git has become increasingly popular over the last 10 years and is a tool that every software developer will encounter.  Having a firm understanding of core git commands is key to success in this course.

## Maven Automated Build Tool

Maven is a build automatoin tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process and eliminates much of the decision making for a development team around how to build packages. It makes the day-to-day work of Java developers easier by eliminating manual tasks and providing a reliable and repeatable build process.
