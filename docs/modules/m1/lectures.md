# Challenges with Secure Software Development Today

Much of the software that comprises software applications is not what is typically developed by a software organization.  The proliferation of open source and 3rd party components has made software development faster, cheaper, better quality, and more secure.  However it also introduces challenges with ensuring and maintaining secure software.
