# Succeeding in This Module

In this module, we will cover the importance of incorporating cyber security practices during the software development cycle.  We will be using the Java programming language as the source code to learn, but the principles can be applied to any modern programming language.  You will also learn the core tools we will be using throughout this core to build a secure, automated software build pipeline.

You are highly encouraged to do the hands-on activities as you watch the lecture videos. They are designed to be followed along as much of the learning comes from using the tools at the command line level.  This will give you a firm understanding of how the tools work before we incorporate them into a more automated build.

Each module in this course builds upon previous concepts.  The project is a progressive built during each module so it is important to successfully complete a modules assigned to be able to work on the next module. It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.
