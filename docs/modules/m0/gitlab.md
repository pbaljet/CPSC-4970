## Getting Started With Gitlab

[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a cloud based [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) tool that we will be using in this
course. An invite was sent your Auburn email address.  We recommend creating an account on Gitlab with your Auburn email address.

Once logged in you will be in your own group and a single project named CPSC4970-\<AU Email\>.  Over the course modules you will progressively build a software application build pipeline with security controls applied.
