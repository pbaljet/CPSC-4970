# Technical Requirements

Completing an online program means that you need to ensure all of your technology is ready. The following outlines the hardware and software requirements for success in the program. In addition to the items listed below, you may be required to use additional programs as part of a specific course.

The [OIT HelpDesk](http://www.auburn.edu/oit/helpdesk/) is available to help you throughout your program at Auburn University by phone and email.

# Internet Browsers

Before exploring your online course, you should ensure that you are using the correct browser. **Your online course is optimized for Google Chrome**, so, if you do not already have the latest version of Chrome installed on your computer, we recommend that you download it now.

- [Update to the latest version of Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/)   
- [The latest version of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)  

You may choose to use another browser, but we cannot guarantee that all course features will function properly in other browsers. If you experience difficulty with multimedia in your course, try changing to Chrome for a better user experience.

# Internet Speed
Our platform is designed to accommodate low bandwidth when needed, but we strongly recommend using a broadband connection (with a minimum speed of 1 Mbps) for optimal access to course materials.

# Tablets
While iPads, Android-based tablets, and Chrome OS tablets can be convenient tools for augmenting the functionality of a traditional laptop, they are not sufficient for completing your schoolwork at Auburn University. All students will need a true laptop computer that meets at least the minimum specifications listed above.

# Antivirus Program
The Virus Policy at Auburn University states that everyone in the Auburn University computing community is expected to take precautions to protect their computers against viruses.
