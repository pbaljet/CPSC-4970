# Getting Started With Discord

This course uses [**Discord**](https://discord.com/brand-new) to facilitate
communication, community, engagement, and course Q&A. Here are a few rules that
everyone should follow when using the course Discord server.

1. Be polite, helpful, and constructive.

2. Don't post solutions to assignments, either before or after the assignment is
   due.

3. You can post basic approaches that you take to a problem, and you may want to
   consider using ||spoiler tags|| (double vertical bars).

4. Don't post your code and ask "Why doesn't this work?" Instead, describe your
   problem, what you have done in an attempt to solve it, and - when necessary -
   post small (5-7 lines) pseudocode snippets like this:

   ```java
   if (some condition is true) {
       do this;
   }
   ```

When you join the server, you will be placed in a limited Guest role. Once you react (thumbs-up) to the rules in the rules channel you will be upgraded to the Student role and the remainder of the categories will appear.

To get started, just paste on the following link in your browser:

> [https://discord.gg/9rPTG5XX](https://discord.gg/9rPTG5XX)

Once you have been granted the student role take a moment to introduce yourself in the introductions channel.  Where you are located, an interesting fact, etc.  During the course it is expected everyone contributes and help each other.
