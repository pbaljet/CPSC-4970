# Assignment 4a - Publishing library jar file to package registry

In this assignment you will be creating an Java JAR library package (aka artifact) to be published to Gitlab package registry for your project.  This artifact will be used later in the course as a dependency for a web application authentication.

Assignment 4a can be found in README.md in your Gitlab group in a repository called "Assignment 4a".
