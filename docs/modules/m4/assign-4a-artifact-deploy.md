# M4 Assignment A - Software Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

In this assignment you will be incorporating dependency scanning into our build pipeline, reviewing discovered vulnerabilities, and resolving them.  You will also be creating a Java JAR library package (aka artifact) to be published to Gitlab package registry for your project.  This artifact will be used later in the course as a dependency for a web application authentication.

M4 Assignment A can be found in README.md in your Gitlab group in a repository called "M4 Assignment A".
