# Succeeding in This Module

Our next step in building a secure software development process is managing and ensuring external dependencies are safe to including in our software application.  Using dependency management tools and understanding the risks associated with dependencies will reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our application from these external sources. 

# Module Objectives

- Understand modern software composition from open source and 3rd party software
- Explain the software supply chain from public and private respositories
- Use Maven to configure specific dependencies to include in our application
- Use Gitlab to include dependency scanning in our build pipeline.
- Be able to publish our own artifacts to an internal repository.
- Understand the purpose of cryptographic hashing to validate file integrity
