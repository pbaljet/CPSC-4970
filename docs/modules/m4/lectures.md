# Log4j Case Study

Much of the Internet, from Amazonâ€™s cloud to connected TVs, is uses with the log4j for logging.  This common framework has been around for 21 years, yet in December 2021 a critical vulnerability was discovered sending the industry into crisis mode.  Log4j is what we call a dependency, a software library required by applications to function.  This case study demonstrates the importance of dependency management from a cyber security perspective.

# Dependency Management
In this lecture we look at the industry trends that are driving the need for Dependency Management.  Automated management tools for identifying vulnerabilities and lowering risk are essential as our software applications are composed mostly of external software not developed with a team.

# Cryptographic Hashing and File Integrity
Validating dependency files have not be tampered ensures the integrity principle is maintained with our dependencies.  Cryptographic hashing is a fundamental method used to validate files.  The following lecture provides an explaination of how these algorithms work.
