# Security in Software Dependency and Composition

In this module we will understand the composition of modern software applications and importance of cyber security as it relates to the external dependencies contained with them.  

A dependency is defined as 3rd Party (commerical software)
or open source software libraries that are required for software application.  Every year the percentage of a software's code base made up of external package dependencies is increasing.  Challenges exit to verify package integrity, ensure they are secure, and continually monitor them for discovered vulnerabilities.  This module explores the current techniques and best practices for managing these risks.
