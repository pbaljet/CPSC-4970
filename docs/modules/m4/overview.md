# Security in Software Dependency and Composition

In this module you will understand the composition of modern software applications and importance of cyber security as it relates to the external dependencies contained with them.  

A dependency is defined as a 3rd Party (commerical software)
or open source software library that is required for a software application.  The percentage of a software's code base made up of external package dependencies increases every year.  Challenges exit to verify package integrity, ensure they are secure, and continually monitor them for discovered vulnerabilities.  This module explores the current techniques and best practices for managing these risks.
