# Security in Software Testing (DAST) & Deployment

In this module we continue to focus on Dynamic Application Security Testing or DAST.  Unlike SAST testing, DAST testing is performed against a running application and attempts to discover vulnerabilities based on the application architecture and integration characteristics.  Since many of public applications are based on the HTTP protocol we will focus the next two modules on web application security.

During module 6 we will also look at a relatively new area called Secrets Management.  Different types of secrets are contained across an organization's technology landscape.  The policies and standards to ensure a strong Cyber Security posture and reduce risk requires secrets to be managed in a more structured manner.  As such we will be exploring what secrets are and how new tools are being deploy to improve how secrets are handled.
