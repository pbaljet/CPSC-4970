# Stuxnet Vulnerability Case Study

In this case study we will look into on of the most sophisticated worms ever built to attack Iranian centrifuges tha were being used to enrich uranium.  The key aspect of this case study is the use of stolen secrets to perform code signing so software could be installed on a system without any warnings.

# HTTP Protocol
The HTTP Protocol in an intregal part of the World Wide Web.  HTTP is used not only for browsers to connect back to web servers, but also for communications between servers and devices such as mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  Most attacks and vulnerabilities occur over HTTP and a good understanding of this protocol is necessary to perform testing and analyze results.

# ZAP DAST Testing Tool
Gitlab uses ZAP for performing automated DAST scanning as part of a build pipeline and integrates it's reporting into Gitlab's security dashboard.  ZAP is the most popular free tool used by both developers and security professionals for both vulnerability and penetration testing.  This lecture cover the high level aspects of ZAP

# Secrets Management
Today’s digital enterprises rely on commercial, internally developed and open source applications to run their businesses and increasingly leverage automated IT infrastructure and DevOps methodologies to speed development and innovation. While application and IT environments vary significantly from organization to organization, one thing remains constant: every application, script, automation tool and other non-human identity relies on some form of privileged credential to access other tools, applications and data.

What is a Secret?
These non-human privileged credentials are often called “secrets” and refer to a private piece of information that acts as a key to unlock protected resources or sensitive information in tools, applications, containers, DevOps and cloud-native environments.

Examples of common secrets:

- Privileged account credentials
- Username & Passwords
- Digital Certificates
- SSH keys
- API keys
- Encryption keys
