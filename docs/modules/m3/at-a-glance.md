# Succeeding in This Module 3

We have learned how to perform a manual security test by analyzing the application structure, understanding the common security vulnerability areas, and the manual testing process.  The next step in building our secure development process is static code analysis by implementing a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool.
# Module Objectives

- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using SAST tools
- Understand the types and classification of issues found
- Update our build pipeline to perform source code analysis
- Execute the process for resolving issues
- Become familiar with SonarQube open source SAST tool
