# Security in Source Code Management Part 2

This module introduces the first part of security testing automation.  Source code scanning has advancement significantly in recent years and has become an expected part of any automated build process.  Most of the known vulnerabilities that exist in a code base are discoverable by scanning tools.  However, there can be a number of [false positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives) because these tools can not tell the higher level architecture, context or execution environment of the software.  A common term used to describe these tools is **S**tatic **A**pplication **S**ecurity **T**esting or **SAST**.  A popular SAST tools is [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) for both quality and security scanning.  This tool will be incorporated into our build pipeline to discover security issues and help manage the resolution process.
