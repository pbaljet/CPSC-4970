# Bringing It All Together

Throughout the course we have been learning the typical methods and tools used to construct a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) or Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC).  In this final module we will wrap up with how an SDL fits into an overall Cyber Security program.  In addition, we will take a look at how security specific logging in our source code fits into a broader Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capability.  Lastly, this final module includes a final project which will have you construct a build pipeline that incorporates all of the methods and tools covered by the course.
