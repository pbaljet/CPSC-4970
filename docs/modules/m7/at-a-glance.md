# Succeeding in This Module 7

In module 7 we will be taking all the security and automation concepts learned throughout the course and building a complete secure software build pipeline.  Leveraging the assignments and lectures from each of the modules you will construct a pipeline to build an existing code base and resolve security vulnerabilities that are found as part of the security testing processes.  

# Module Objectives

- Importance of security logging in applications for SIEM capability
- Understand Secure Development Lifecycle in an overall Cyber Security Program
- Construct an end to end build pipeline incorporating security testing methods.
- Resolve security vulnerabilities found during each testing method.
- Understand how the build pipeline supports DevOps capabilities.
